                A <term>fraction</term> is a way of representing parts of a whole number.  Fractions take the form <m>\dfrac{a}{b}</m>.  The top of a fraction is called the <term>numerator</term> and the bottom is called the <term>denominator</term>.  The denominator tells us how many parts we break the whole number into, and the numerator tells us how many parts we have.  Take the fraction <m>\dfrac{5}{12}</m> as an example. The fraction says that we are splitting a whole number into 12 total pieces, but we only have 5 of those pieces.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are two kinds of fractions we'll deal with: proper fractions and improper fractions.  A <term>proper fraction</term> is a fraction whose numerator is smaller than its denominator; <m>\dfrac{5}{12}</m> is an example of a proper fraction.  An <term>improper fraction</term> is a fraction whose numerator is larger than the denominator; an example of an improper fraction is <m>\dfrac{8}{3}</m>.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Fractions are one way of representing numbers broken out into parts.  Another way is by using decimals. A <term>decimal</term> is composed of two pieces: whole numbers greater than one (written on the left hand side of the decimal point) and numbers smaller than one (written to the right of the decimal point).
            </p>

            <p>
                To write a fraction as a decimal, we perform division.  For example, to convert the fraction <m>\dfrac{2}{5}</m> to a decimal, we do 2 divided by 5.  Whether by long division or by calculator, we get the decimal value <m>0.4</m>.

                    A vat has a salt concentration of 5 grams per liter.  More brine is added to the mixture to raise the concentration to 9 grams per liter in 2 hours.  At what rate did the concentration change?

                    A 1473 class was polled about political alignment.  It was determined that the ratio of Democrats to Independents was 3:2.  If the ratio of Democrats to Republicans was 1:1, how many independents are in this class of 32 students?
